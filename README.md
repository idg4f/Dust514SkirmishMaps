Dust514SkirmishMaps
===================

A simple map viewer for Dust 514 skirmish maps.

I wrote this code when I was playing dust and after I was 
given my layoff notice from IBM.  I did it to demonstrate I 
could publish to andriod market and my coding experience with android.

I don't consider it my best demo of android programming experience. 
I think the swtor toon tracker is much better.  I spent a lot of time
on that one. It uses sqlite and pretty much does all io based upon
sql queries.

This app also used library code I found on the net which had an 
apache license.  I felt it was fair to give the original author 
of that code recogniztion as well as the legal requirements to do
so.  I truly appreciate his efforts.

With that said, I quit playing that game a while back and don't really
feel like working on it anymore.
